    <p class="subheading">How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</p>
    <p>
        There's a lot of people out there and in my life, especially, that get too stuck in the past, which is just an excuse to stay the way they are, but honestly, with a little understanding, I think it could open a lot of eyes to the potential that they have inside of themselves.

    <p class="subheading">
      How will I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit?
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning to eliminate all distractions while doing a task to eventually not even have to think about it. <br>
        as well as spacing learning out to not do too much at one time but also keep up a steady pace. I'd really like to be coding at least one hour a day as well on the side, keeping up with weight training, without canceling out on either.

      Some ways to increase neuroplasticity
    </p>
    <p>
        If you were looking to increase your own neuroplasticity, it's all in the practice. Whatever venture you're trying to learn, just keep cracking at it, and in doing so, you're strengthening your brain.

    <br>
    <p class="subheading" >What is a growth Mindset & why is it relavant</p>
    <p>A growth mindset is believing that a person's abilities aren't capped but can be improved with effort, learning, and persistence. To me, this is relevant because throughout high school I believed I was a fixed mindset person (although I didn't know the term existed). I was just very negative towards learning, but now I'm very open to learning and a lot more willing to put in the time and effort. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading" >blending all this with my learning plan!</p>
    <p>Blending these two concepts with my work plan, I hope it's going to be a simple transition, but we'll see. The plan is to try at least to do some sort of coding once a day; it's pretty achievable. Some days may be harder than others, but I feel even on a late work day a little 30-minute session won't hurt. With trying to overcome the obstacles with a more relaxed and growth mindset, it will definitely come I just have to pound it into my brain that I'm doing this for me.</p>
