    <p>
        There's a lot of people out there and in my life, especially, that get too stuck in the past, which is just an excuse to stay the way they are, but honestly, with a little understanding, I think it could open a lot of eyes to the potential that they have inside of themselves.

      How will I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit?
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning to eliminate all distractions while doing a task to eventually not even have to think about it. <br>
        as well as spacing learning out to not do too much at one time but also keep up a steady pace. I'd really like to be coding at least one hour a day as well on the side, keeping up with weight training, without canceling out on either.
