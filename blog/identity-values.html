      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the hardest out of the 5 questions to answer. I think most days
      we make ethical decisions, but it's quite hard to recall something. It
      took some thinking, but what I came to was that last year my partner's
      birthday lined up to be on the same day as my work due. which was a bit
      sucky because I was quite excited for this, but as soon as I got the date
      for it, I knew what the right decision was. I wasn't about to abandon my
      partner to go have a few drinks with some workmates because I can do that
      whenever throughout the week, so of course I chose the ethically right
      options and took my partner out to dinner.

      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.

    <p>
      The people who have had the biggest influence on me would be my parents
      and my partner. My parents played a massive role in showing me work ethic
      and persistence, seeing them while growing up sacrifice things for
      personal growth and well-being. really shaped me into the person I am now
      my partner, on the other hand, taught me a lot about patience just by
      showing me that good things take a while to achieve. Some things take
      weeks, months, and even years, but it's all about dedicating yourself to
      it and not giving up.

      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think my biggest strength is not wanting to fail in anything I do, which
      sometimes works its way into being an obsession in my work. An example of
      that is the job I'm in now. When I started, I had no idea about anything.
      I'd never thought a day in my life about doing road works, but after a
      couple of weeks, I fell in love with it. I wanted to learn everything
      there was to learn, and I wanted to be the best at it. It quickly became
      an obsession. I was working long hours, getting paid more money than I'd
      ever had, and best of all, learning every day. I went from just a normal
      worker to a supervisor in 8 months, which I was pretty proud of, but just
      because I got there didn't mean I was done. It was just a new role to
      learn, which was amazing till now, I'm kind of burnt out. I don't love the
      job anymore. I learned everything there was. I'm kind of stagnant now, but
      I've always loved technology, and from my understanding, programming is an
      ever-growing field, so that's the most exciting thing for me, knowing that
      even when this learning journey is over, it'll never actually be finished.

      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think time management will play the biggest card in my learning journey,
      not because I'm bad at managing time, mainly because my work schedule is a
      bit messy. Some days I might only work 4 hours, but most days are between
      12-14 hours, which I'm a little concerned is going to mess with my
      progression. But I'm going to keep grinding and not let that stop me. I
      understood the time commitment I needed to start this journey. I'm not
      going to allow a busy schedule to affect that negatively.

      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other

      As previously mentioned, I'm a supervisor at the place I work, which has
      its ups and downs. Sometimes we get offered something called a stay away,
      which means we get to go somewhere else in New Zealand for a bit and get
      paid to work there. At this time we were going to Palmy, and even better,
      I had two of my closest mates coming along with me. We were set to be
      there for three weeks, which was awesome. We were getting paid more to be
      away from home, and we were all mates, so it was going to be a great time,
      right? And it was for the first week and a half until tensions were
      getting a bit high. We were doing some crazy hours, coming closer to 16
      hours most days and 6-day weeks, so we were all tired. but I kept trying
      to have the morale high until one of my mates must have just had a worse
      day than the rest of us and kind of held onto it for a few days to the
      point where he wouldn't really talk to me or our other mate, which is
      completely understandable for a bit, but after a few days it became harder
      and harder to do our job because it requires a lot of communication.
      Through this whole thing, I'm trying to keep everyone happy, but I snapped
      at one point when I had him alone and just told him I understand he's
      probably tired and it's a bit shit being away from home for so long, but I
      can't have one half of my team not talking to me after a few minutes of
      talking. We were alright again he was back to normal. He was just
      stressed, and like I said, being away from home sucks for longer periods
      of time. I'm not sure how I would have handled it differently. I'm very
      fortunate that he's my best friend, so even though the tensions were high,
      I felt comfortable talking to him about these things. Maybe a more
      professional manner would have been to wait until the day had finished.
