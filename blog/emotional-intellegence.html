  <p class="subheading">What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>

  <p>
    Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is the ability to manage your emotions and
    have an understanding of those around you. A person with a high IQ can
    identify how they're feeling and understand what those feelings mean.
    Usually people in leadership roles will have high EQ
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="subheading">How is EQ different to IQ?</p>
  <p>
    IQ is used to measure cognitive abilities like logical reasoning, problem
    solving, and analytical skills, while EQ is an understanding of emotions and
    how to manage them, as well as empathizing with others and building
    relationships
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="subheading">Why is EQ important?</p>
  <p>
    EQ is important in navigating complex social interactions as well as
    building strong relationships with people. In a work place you want to have
    self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, and effective communication
    skills, which weighs heavy on the EQ side
