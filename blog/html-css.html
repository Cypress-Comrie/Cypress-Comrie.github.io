      In this blog post i'll be sharing with you guys what ive learned about the
      different positions used in css.<br />
      i'll be using my logo/home button for the examples.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="subheading">relative</p>
    <p>
      The relative position itself wont change much of anything it'll just keep
      what you have in the normal flow, but you can add properties like (top,
      bottom, left, right) to change its position on the screen which will
      include overlapping other elements
    </p>
    <img class="blog-photo" src="images/relative.PNG" alt="blog-photo" />
    <br />
    <p style="margin-top: 4vh">
      Here you can see its just fitting itself into the natural order
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="subheading">Absolute</p>
    <p>
      This one is a little more janky, Instead of sitting in the natural flow of
      everything it'll create its own flow completely ignoring all the other
      elements, using the properties listed above also works differently.
      Instead of changing the position of where it is when things are normal.
      the distance changed will be from each of the containing elements sides.
    </p>
    <img class="blog-photo" src="images/absolute.PNG" alt="blog-photo" />
    <p style="margin-top: 4vh">
      In this one its where I want the logo to be but it will stay in that
      corner forever
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="subheading">Fixed</p>
    <p>
      Fixed positions work similarly to Absolutes, It fixes the element to a
      visible portion of the view point that basically just means it'll stay on
      your screen even when you're scrolling away from it
    </p>
    <img class="blog-photo" src="images/fixed.PNG" alt="blog-photo" />
    <p style="margin-top: 4vh">
      Last of all I scrolled down a little bit and the logo followed me down
      which would've happened on your screen as well (unless you're on a phone)
    </p>
    <footer><a href="html-css.html">Back to top</a></footer>
