    <p class="subheading">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
    <p>
      My long-term career goal is to be working in my first programming job by
      the start of next year, I'm truly grateful for the opportunities I've been
      Given the place I work now, I've just come to realize it's not the field I
      want to be in anymore
    </p>

      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </p>
    <p>
      My strengths are I'm very determined I like to strive to be as good as I
      can at something, almost to the point of obsession. My limitations at the
      moment would only be my job it requires me to work real fluctuating hours.
      Some days I could only work 4 hours other days I'll work upwards of 12.
      The early days are great because then I've got plenty of time to study and
      work on my way through the sprints, but if I get a full week of 12+ hour
      days, I start to lag behind, which is one of my biggest concerns.

      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to be a bit more social and reach out a bit more. I tend to hold
      myself back and do stuff on my own, which is a habit I'd like to break.

      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will stick to the timeframes as closely as I can, making sure that when
      things do get overwhelming, I take a break and come back. to it with a
      fresh mindset instead of trying to force myself through something that's
      just not working at that moment, I've done this previously while creating
      this website, I hit a couple of mind blanks along the way, so I took the
      night to relax. And that's when things would start to make sense and I
      would realize what I was doing wrong and go fix it.

    <p class="subheading">
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    </p>
    <p>
      If I'm stuck on something and unable to figure it out myself, I generally
      go to Google first to try to find a solution, but if I'm out of luck with
      Google I'd go into the home group on Discord to ask.

      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd just expect them to understand for most of us, this is the first time
      ever doing coding, but they have not disappointed. They're all lovely.
