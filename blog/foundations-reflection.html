    <p class="subheading" >What are three things I learnt about myself due to the human skills learning?</p>
    <p> I'm not sure I'll be able to do three things, but one of the biggest things I learned was putting my ego aside to ask for help, in my brain I associated asking for help as an admittance that I couldn't figure it out, which is completely fine. It just took that little nudge for me to accept that in myself. Now I'm way more confident to ask for help
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</p>
    <p>Â Values are having things like quality standards, so having good code in the sense that it's readable. and efficient as well as having a growth mindset. Empathy, like values, is making sure you've written down comments to give a brief explanation of your code for others or understanding the needs of the users of your website  Self-awareness is learning how you best retain knowledge, whether that be reading it and understanding it or taking notes, but always practice makes perfect. and knowing when to ask for help and when to stick it out and figure it out yourself

    <p class="subheading">What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</p>
    <p>It's actually quite enjoyable to learn about the intricacies in ourselves.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading">What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</p>
    <p>Listening and looping is not exactly a challenging task, just an awkward one for myself, but it has helped in making me less shy/awkward. I do honestly think it's more of an online thing. In person, I'm very charismatic and outgoing, but over the internet, it just felt strange, but it's definitely getting easier.

    <p class="subheading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>
    <p>I know it's because most employers aren't just looking for a good programmer, they're looking for a good person to add to their team, and often times they'll take the personality over skill.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading">Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</p>
    <p>I'll be honest, at the beginning I did feel like it was a bit stupid, but now I do understand it's for the better, and I really don't even mind it at all.</p>
