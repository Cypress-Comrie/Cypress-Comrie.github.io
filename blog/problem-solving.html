    <h2>being stuck on a simple problem</h2>
    <p class="subheading" >what was the problem</p>
    <p>Honestly, out of all the things I got stuck on throughout the Java Script Kata module, I think 

        The simplest problem was during the debits when all I needed to do was make sure it would remove the string "buzz."
        
        Regardless of capitalization, now originally I thought, Damn, how is this going to work? I started writing a pretty big piece of code, which honestly started to confuse me. 
        
        So I stopped for a minute, thought about it a little more, then decided to go to Google for a bit of advice, just to find out. 
        
     I didn't need a full new line of code; I just needed to add one method to one piece of my already written-out code. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading" >what problem solving technique did I use?</p>
    <p>

        I took the easiest route and used good old Google. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading" >how did I feel throughout the process?</p>
    <p>It was a little frustrating finding out it was such a simple fix but also a nice feeling knowing 

        That next time I know exactly how to do it
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading" >what did I learn</p>
    <p>

        I learned that sometimes you've just got to sit back and try not to overcomplicate what you're doing. I found my 
        
        I was self-thinking too much instead of keeping it simple, which nine times out of ten it was a pretty simple fix.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>elegantly solved problem</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading" >what was the problem?</p>
    <p>Going through the manipulating objects module, I got a little confused at first with adding to 

      The objects were instead of soft coding them in; I was hard coding them in, which caused the tests to start failing, which got me thinking. 
      
      What's happening? So I read through the tests a little more thoroughly and figured out I was meant to be adding them in with code instead of manually.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading" >what problem-solving techniques did I use?</p>
    <p>I used a mixture between trying something and reading error. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading" >how did I feel throughout the process?</p>
    <p>Going through this was actually pretty good for me it made me feel pretty confident in myself and my ability to do some entry.

      Entry-level problem solving  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheading">what did I learn </p>
    <p>I learned that taking time to read through and try things is a very good way to keep calm and work through the problems. </p>

    <h2>A reflection on how confident I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h2>
    <ul class="grid-3" >
      <i style="  color: #fcfafa;" >Pseudocode</i>
      <i>I'm still trying to get the hang of using this, but I can see it being very useful in the future.</i>
      <i style="  color: #fcfafa;">Trying something</i>
      <i>I've been finding trying things kinda effective; if something doesn't work out the first time, I will try everything I can think of first before relying on anything else.</i>
      <i style="  color: #fcfafa;">Rubber ducky method</i>
      <i>I haven't used this one much, but I definitely will.</i>
      <i style="  color: #fcfafa;">Reading error messages</i>
      <i>This is very useful; error messages have been a massive savior. Often times, I'll misspell something or add a random letter here and there, so error messages come in clutch.</i>
      <i style="  color: #fcfafa;">Console.logging</i>
      <i> Console logging has come in very useful as well, particularly in the super flip-flop module; it showed me that I had done it all right, but for some reason it just wasn't registering that in the tests.</i>
      <i style="  color: #fcfafa;">Googling</i>
      <i>Googling has come in insanely handy over the time of this course; learning to google the right things has been super valuable too.</i>
      <i style="  color: #fcfafa;">Asking your peers and or coaches for help</i>
      <i>I definitely struggled with this one a bit, but I've slowly gotten a bit more comfortable with this, especially over the duration of this sprint. </i>
      <i style="  color: #fcfafa;">Improving your process with reflection</i>
      <i>I definitely feel as though his reflections are great for a bit of remembrance of what you've just finished and help with retaining all the information.</i>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Reflect on a time I was reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made me reluctant to do so. What might I try differently next time?</h3>
    <p>During this sprint, I had to ask for help during the super flip-flop module. The only reason I was reluctant to do so was because I wanted to be able to do it on my own, but I had to suck up my own pride and ask for help, which honestly isn't a bad thing to do, and I genuinely enjoyed getting the feedback I needed to progress. I think next time I won't be so nervous to ask for help. </p>
