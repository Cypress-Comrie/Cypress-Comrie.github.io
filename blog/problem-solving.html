    <h2>being stuck on a simple problem</h2>
    <p class="subheading" >what was the problem</p>

        Regardless of capitalization, now originally I thought, Damn, how is this going to work? I started writing a pretty big piece of code, which honestly started to confuse me. 
        
        So I stopped for a minute, thought about it a little more, then decided to go to Google for a bit of advice, just to find out.

    <p>

        I took the easiest route and used good old Google. </p>

        I learned that sometimes you've just got to sit back and try not to overcomplicate what you're doing. I found my
